- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rishi2929

What's up fellow coders! I'm just a MERN newb trying to become a Jed- MERN master.

I've built multiple websites with HTML & CSS. I don't mean to brag, but i know least 8 CSS properties off the top of my head.

My JavaScript is getting pretty sharp too. I've copied code from way more advanced places than just StackOverflow.

React is my jam! I've built real-world sites like estates websites where people can browse properties and contact agents. So I'm practically a React master.

Express and Node are still a bit mystical to me if I'm being honest. But I can kinda, sorta build a backend that doesn't immediately crash!

And MongoDB? I'm crushing it! I successfully connected Mongo to multiple projects with only minor breakdowns!

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading error messages and crying in the fetal position. But don't worry, I'm well on my way to becoming a MERN master!

So if any of you MERN sages want to bless me with your wisdom, I'll be here struggling through my tutorial purgatory. Take pity on this MERN stack apprentice!
